# Steppin' Razor - a JVM in assembler (mostly)

Rule one of Steppin' Razor: don't ask why. ;-)

## What already works

So far, there is a program that can read a file generated by catmother-bytecodeexporter (see https://github.com/profmaad/catmother) and execute the contained method. It will display the result on stdout (given that it is an int or float - so far).

To see which instructions are already implemented, do:
    grep 'dq opcode_impl\.' jvm.asm | sed 's/\tdq opcode_impl\.//'
