	;; uint16_t max_locals == rsi
	;; uint8_t* bytecode == rdx
	;; union java_runtime_constant_pool_entry *runtime_cp == rcx

;; stack layout:
	;; operand stack (grows upwards)	<-- [rsp]
	;; local variable 0			<-- [r11]
	;; ...

	;; r10: position in bytecode
	;; r11: start of local variable storage (points to lv0)
	;; r12: location of runtime constant pool
